<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Dahl Makhani is a butter dahl and is my favourite dahl recipe. Easy to make and good for batch cooking.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>T
        <li>To Pressure Cook
        3/4 cup urad dal sabut (whole black lentil) 165 grams
        1/4 cup rajma (red kidney beans) 60 grams
        1 teaspoon salt
        3.5 cups water 28 oz</li>
        Masala for the Dal
        <li>1 tablespoon ghee</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 medium white onion 115 grams, finely grated</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ginger garlic paste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup tomato puree</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kashmiri red chili powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon garam masala</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt or to taste</li>
        <li>1.5 cups water 12 oz, as needed</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cream 60 ml</li>
        
    </ul>
<h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash and rinse urad dal (whole black lentil) and rajma (kidney beans) in a large bowl. Soak in 3 cups water overnight.</li>
        <li>Drain the water in which the dal and rajma was soaked. Transfer the dal and rajma to a pressure cooker with 1 teaspoon salt. Add around 3.5 cups water.</li>
        <li>Pressure cook on high-medium heat for 10 minutes, then lower the heat to low-medium and cook for another 10 minutes. In total around 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mash some of the dal and rajma using a potato masher. Then turn on the heat to lowest heat and let the dal simmer while you make the masala.</li>
        <li>To make the masala, in a large pot/pan, heat 2 tablespoons butter. Cook the onion for around 6 to 7 minutes or until it turns light golden brown. Keep stirring it continuously so that it doesn't burn and keep heat on medium.</li>
        <li>Add the ginger garlic paste and cook for 1 to 2 minute until the raw smell goes away.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato puree and mix. Cook for 2 minutes or until the puree mixes well with masala and oil starts oozing out from the sides.</li>
        <li>Add in the boiled dal (which had been simmering for around 10 to 15 mins you were making the masala) and mix.</li>
        <li>Add garam masala, kashmiri red chili powder and salt. Mix to combine.</li>
        <li>Add 1/2 cup water, stir and set heat to low. Let it simmer on low heat uncovered for around 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add sugar and mix after the dal has simmered for 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter and 1/4 cup cream. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Simmer for 10 more minutes on low heat after adding the cream. Dal will become really creamy by now.</li>
        
        </ol>
